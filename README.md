Rivet Chain is a public blockchain architecture, which can solve the problem of streaming media transmission between public chain and side chain. It is a Byzantine fault-tolerant security consensus engine with high performance, consistent characteristics and the ability to prevent vandalism under strict bidirectional accountability. The consensus algorithm is very suitable for PoW + PoS proof mechanism under public block chain, through the use of link adaptation space, the content of the building is essentially the ultimate abstract base layer to achieve this: with a built-in Turing complete programming language block chain, allowed to write intelligent contracts and distributed application, for ownership and transaction format and state transition function to create your own rules.
It enables cross-chain interoperability between blockchains, USES decentralized storage and merckle trees, and trades only on critical chains, thus greatly reducing the congestion dilemma of the main chain network.
