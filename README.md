  The side Chain allows the Rivet Chain to move easily between the blockchain and the side Chain and allows new requirements to be validated on the side Chain. In the Rivet Chain Hub, the side Chain and the Rivet Chain are micro-clients of each other, and the RTSP is used to demonstrate movement between the Rivet Chain and the side Chain. The core mechanism for two-way links is in principle the same as that used by the Rivet Chain.
  Rivet Chain is currently working on a number of different strategies to spatialize the state of the blockchain to address the need for scalability. The goal of these efforts is to maintain the abstraction layer provided by the current virtual machine over the Shared state space. At present,a number of research work is underway.

RivetChain is a private ethereum chain.
